I build mathematical models for lithium batteries at **[Bazant Group, MIT](https://bazantgroup.mit.edu/shakul-pathak/)**. I have over 4 years of experience in computational research, developing physics models for battery performance estimation, design, and safety assessment and contributing to several [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6gel9QYAAAAJ&hl=en) in battery technology. More broadly, I'm passionate to help tough technologies scale faster using specialized models that minimize long, costly experiments.
