I build mathematical models for lithium batteries at **[Bazant Group, MIT](https://bazantgroup.mit.edu/shakul-pathak/)**. I have over 4 years of experience in computational modeling, contributing to several [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6gel9QYAAAAJ&hl=en) and a pending patent in battery technology. I'm passionate about helping tough technologies scale faster through mathematical modeling.

I specialize in computational modeling of electrochemical systems, developing physics models for battery performance estimation, design, and safety assessment. My work spans finite volume methods, numerical modeling and machine learning for complex systems.
