**MIT Researcher** | **Mathematical Modeling** | **Battery Technology Enthusiast**

I build mathematical models that help lithium batteries scale quicker. I have over four years of experience shaping numerical/analytical physics (electrochemistry, mechanics) models (FVM, ML) for performance estimation, guided design, safety and health assessment of lithium batteries at the Bazant Group, MIT (co-authored 8+ publications and a pending patent).

I recently completed my Master's in Chemical Engineering Practice (MSCEP) at MIT ChemE in 2024 (GPA 5/5). Aside from this, I completed a minor in entrepreneurial finance to help me make my work translate to the real-world. I have significant exposure to venture creation through leadership and fellowship programs at MIT.

In the past, I have worked at SLB (formerly Schlumberger), to reveal critical bottlenecks in lithium refining processes and performing feasibility checks on electrolyzers in traditional manufacturing. Furthermore, I have worked at AstraZeneca, making math/ML control logic for perfusion bioreactors and making an automated pneumatic system for testing therapeutic injectors.

Outside of this, during my undergrad, I gained significant research experience doing computational modeling with Prof. Karthik Shekhar at UC Berkeley, Dr. David Zwicker at Max Planck Institute of Dynamics and Self-Organization (MPIDS), Prof. David Sivak at Simon Fraser University and Prof. Sunando DasGupta at my alma mater, IIT Kharagpur.

I enjoy learning business, new ventures, writing code, exploring new math, long walks and discovering new food. I'm curious about next-generation batteries, separation tech, and AI for science all of which connect to my passion for helping tough tech (such as batteries) scale faster with fewer long/costly experiments.
